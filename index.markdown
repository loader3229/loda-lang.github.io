LODA is an assembly language, a computational model, and a distributed tool for mining programs. You can use it to generate and search programs that compute integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®](https://oeis.org/) (OEIS®). The goal of the project is to reverse engineer formulas and efficient algorithms for a wide range of non-trivial integer sequences.

## The LODA Language

LODA means _Lexicographical Order Descent Assembly_. It is an assembly-based language for solving number-theoretic problems. It has a simple syntax and a rich set of arithmetic operations. This enables an automated search of new programs and algorithms using a process called [program mining](/mining). In a nutshell, we use distributed compute power, smart search algorithms and machine-learning to find
programs and formulas for the integer sequences from the OEIS database.

To get an idea of the language, you can search browse through the available [programs](https://programs.loda-lang.org/?keywords=loda) or search using keywords.
A comprehensive overview of the language concepts and the supported operations is available in the [language specification](spec).

## Contributing

Running the [LODA miners](/mining) is a community project. We are grateful for the many contributions we receive. Here is a list of the [top contributors](https://boinc.loda-lang.org/loda/top_users.php) of the LODA BOINC project. If you have spare compute power and like to contribute to the project, please checkout our [mining info page](/mining)!

LODA is open source and hosted in the [loda-lang](https://github.com/loda-lang) organization on GitHub. If you encounter any bugs, have ideas for new features, or wish to contribute code, we warmly welcome you to open issues or pull requests. For general inquiries or discussions, feel free to join us on our [Discord](https://loda-lang.org/discord) or contact us via e-mail. Your contributions and engagement are greatly appreciated!
