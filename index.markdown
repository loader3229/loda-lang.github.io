LODA is an assembly language, a computational model and a tool for mining integer sequences. You can use it to search programs that calculate integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®](https://oeis.org/) (OEIS®).

## Getting Started

To get started, you can check out these resources:

* [Specification](spec) of the LODA language.
* [Online Editor](edit/?oeis=45){: .btn } to try it out yourself.
* [Mined Programs](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs) of OEIS integer sequences.
* [Dashboard](http://loda.ckrause.org/grafana): Grafana dashboard for the miners.

There are currently more than 35k programs available! You can find lists with descriptions and links here:

* [A000001-A050000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list0.md), [A050001-A100000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list1.md), [A100001-A150000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list2.md), [A150001-A200000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list3.md)
* [A200001-A250000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list4.md), [A250001-A300000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list5.md), [A300001-A350000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list6.md), [A350001-A400000](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/blob/main/oeis/list7.md)

If you want to receive updates on new miner findings, you can follow the [commits in loda-programs](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/commits/main) or subscribe to the [@lodaminer](https://twitter.com/lodaminer) channel on Twitter, or join us in the [loda-lang workspace](https://loda-lang.slack.com/) on Slack.

## Development

The source code of LODA is hosted in the [loda-lang organization](https://github.com/loda-lang) on GitHub. These are some of its main repositories:

* [loda-cpp](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp): Interpreter and miner written in C++.
* [loda-rust](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-rust): Interpreter and web interface written in Rust.
