LODA is an open-source project focused on the systematic discovery and analysis of programs and formulas for integer sequences, with a particular emphasis on those catalogued in the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences® (OEIS®)](https://oeis.org/).

The project integrates a minimalist assembly language and a distributed mining infrastructure. Its overarching objective is to reverse engineer efficient algorithms and closed-form expressions for a broad spectrum of non-trivial integer sequences, thereby advancing mathematical knowledge and the automation of program synthesis. The core components of LODA are:

- **Domain-Specific Language:** A minimalist assembly language and computational model designed for number-theoretic and combinatorial algorithms for integer sequences. The language's design prioritizes both human readability and machine interpretability, enabling both manual inspection and automated analysis and optimization.
- **Distributed Mining Infrastructure:** LODA uses distributed computing, advanced search methods and machine learning to autonomously find new programs and closed-form representations for integer sequences.

## Getting Started

- Browse the [LODA program database](https://loda-lang.org/programs) to access a wide range of programs corresponding to OEIS sequences.
- Install the [LODA command-line tool](https://loda-lang.org/install) to execute programs on your local machine.
- Contribute computational resources by running a miner to assist in the automated search for new programs. For details, see [how to contribute](/contributing).
- Read the [LODA specification](/spec) for a comprehensive guide to the language's syntax and operational semantics.
- Contact us and join discussions on our [Discord server](https://loda-lang.org/discord).
