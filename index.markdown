LODA is an assembly language, a computational model, and a distributed tool for mining programs. You can use it to generate and search programs that compute integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®](https://oeis.org/) (OEIS®). The goal of the project is to reverse engineer formulas and efficient algorithms for a wide range of non-trivial integer sequences.

**Note:** Program mining using BOINC is currently on hold due to maintenance activities and development of new algorithms.

## The LODA Language

LODA means _Lexicographical Order Descent Assembly_. It is an assembly-based language for solving number-theoretic problems. It has a simple syntax and a rich set of arithmetic operations. This enables an automated search of new programs and algorithms using a process called _program mining_. In a nutshell, we use distributed compute power, smart search algorithms and machine-learning to find programs and formulas for the integer sequences from the OEIS database.

To get an idea of the language, you can search browse through the available [programs](https://programs.loda-lang.org/?keywords=loda) or search using keywords.
A comprehensive overview of the language concepts and the supported operations is available in the [language specification](spec).
