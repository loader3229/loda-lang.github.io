LODA is a collaborative, open-source project dedicated to discovering, analyzing, and sharing integer sequence programs. There are several ways you can get involved and make a meaningful impact‚Äîwhether you have spare compute power, enjoy writing programs, or want to help improve the codebase.

## 1. Program Mining

Help discover new and more efficient programs for integer sequences by running LODA miners. Mining is a community effort, and every contribution helps expand the database of known programs.

- üñ•Ô∏è **Join the [LODA project on BOINC](https://boinc.loda-lang.org/loda/):** Donate your compute power to the distributed mining network.
- üèóÔ∏è **Run the [LODA command-line miner](/install):** Mine programs locally on your own machine.

All mined programs are credited to their contributors and stored in the [loda-programs](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs) repository. You can track mining progress and statistics on the [mining dashboard](https://dashboard.loda-lang.org/grafana/).

## 2. Submitting Programs via the API

If you have written a LODA program for an integer sequence, you can submit it directly to the project:

- üì§ **Use the [LODA API](https://api.loda-lang.org/v2/openapi):** Submit new or improved programs for OEIS sequences. The API allows you to contribute programs, suggest optimizations, and help grow the collection.
- üìù **Program Guidelines:** Please ensure your submission follows the [LODA specification](/spec) and includes a reference to the relevant OEIS sequence (e.g., A-number).

Your contributions will be reviewed and, if accepted, added to the public repository with credit to you.

## 3. Contributing to the Codebase on GitHub

LODA is open source and welcomes code contributions of all kinds:

- üêû **Report bugs or request features:** Open an issue in the relevant [loda-lang GitHub repository](https://github.com/loda-lang).
- üîÄ **Submit pull requests:** Help improve the miners, web tools, documentation, or other components. See the repository README for setup and contribution guidelines.
- üí¨ **Join the discussion:** Connect with the community on [Discord](https://loda-lang.org/discord) or via e-mail for questions, ideas, or collaboration.

## Recognition and Community

We are grateful for every contribution! Top contributors are recognized on the [LODA BOINC leaderboard](https://boinc.loda-lang.org/loda/top_users.php). All accepted programs and code contributions are credited to their authors.

Thank you for helping advance the LODA project and the study of integer sequences!
